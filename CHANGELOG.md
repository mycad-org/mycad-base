v0.2
====
- a super super "simple" (note the quotes) vulkan renderer is implemented. The
  executable is `mycad-vk`
- `mycad::Entity` can be visualized in `mycad-vk` - again, super rudimentary
  (only lines at the moment)
- the beginnings of an opengl renderer, `mycad-vis` is still around, though
  we'll probably get rid of this

v.01
====
- initial numbered version
- the most rudimentary of `mycad::Entity` is implemented, allowing to create
  topological "Vertex" associated with a geometric "Edge" as well as topological
  "Edge" associated with a geometric "Line"
- Let's go! üòç
